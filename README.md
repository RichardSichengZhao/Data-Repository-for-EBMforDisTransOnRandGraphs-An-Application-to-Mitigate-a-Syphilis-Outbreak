## File Description
### 1. [Degree Seq 19-23 Init.csv](Degree Seq 19-23 Init.csv): Aggregated degree sequences initially collected from data and modified/adjusted as described to article.

### 2. [Time Distribution 19-23_ReInfection.xlsx](Time Distribution 19-23_ReInfection.xlsx): Aggregated and anonymized data for syphilis stages of reported cases and encounter date, together with the "recovery date" after adjustment described in the article. Used to generate the incident data and the recovery time distribution

### 3. [Time Test Adj.csv](Time Test Adj.csv): Biweekly aggregated reported casecount after adjustment for treament duration used for fitting the parameters of model.
